### Game Introduction

Quest 64 is non-traditional RPG with unique turn-based combat that revolves around its magic system.  The player (Brian) will learn magic through traditional battle experience and by collecting spirits on the world map, learning new spells as different thresholds are reached.  

In short, the route is constructed with a few goals in mind:
- Surviving the 1st boss (leveling our stats)
- Having having the required spells for the 2nd and 3rd bosses
- Having enough items to survive later bosses
- Minimizing overworld combat*

with the last bullet being particularly important for more nuanced time management, but less important when starting out.
