## Quest 64 Glitchless Any % Guide

Hey there! 👋

If you are reading this, then you likely have an interest in either learning how to run Quest 64 or on improving an existing time.  In either case, this guide will attempt to be of use to you by including basic information for new runners and additional sections / comments for some of the more nuanced timeplay.

This guide will include a few notes on how to optimize the run overall, but those will be included towards the end of that section.

**🛑 Before Continuing:** While this guide will eventually become more thorough and beginner-friendly, atm the reader is assumed to be familiar with the base game and location of spirits / items.  If this isn't the case, then watching a VOD of Glitchless All Spirits on 2x speed may be more useful atm.

**🛠 Work In Progress**: This guide will be slowly updated as I have time to make it, so things will likely be fairly barebones for awhile.

## Route Introduction

Within the Quest community, Glitchless categories have a reputation for being somewhat brutal.  Between reseting on bosses, moving backwards from random encounters, and associating disappointment with the `Miss!` sound, this has every Quest category can seem punishing.

In short, this category has a few goals in mind.

1. Survive Solvaring
2. Learn Avalanche for Zelse
3. Kill Bosses with Magic Barrier + Avalanche
4. Grind Defense along the way
5. Do not go backwards if you can avoid it

For the last bit, we can accomplish this by intentionally getting hit by enemies that cast multi-hit moves like Wind Cutter or Homing Arrow.  

### Boss Cheat Sheet

We try to have specific stat / spirit values to both help with the bosses themselves and provide a mile marker for how big Brian is becoming throughout the run. The main ones are included here in a table here for quick reference.

|⚔|Boss Health|Earth Goal|Water Goal|Health Goal|Mana Goal|Comments|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Solvaring**|200|1|16-17+|61+|15+|Survive 3 attacks|
|**Zelse**|680|24|19 or 23|82+|19+|Survive 2 attacks|
|**Nepty**|880|36|25|98+|21+|You get Magic Barrier at 36 Earth|
|**Shilf**|1000|48+|25|115+|22+|Survive two attacks|
|**Fargo**|1500|50|30+|136+|24+|Not very dangerous|
|**Guilty**|1800|50|35+|158+|24+|Two melee attacks always kill you|
|**King Beigis**|1900|50|38+|183+|25+|Survive 2 attacks|
|**Mammon**|2300|50|40+|208+|25+|Can kill you if you show up low on items|

### Section Breakdown

To simplify reading, we will break the guide into a boss-related sections.  

Each section will begin with a table outlining a beginner-friendly set of stats for Brian to have when fighting that boss, as well as a few notes on how that fight can go sideways.  The section will then cover the walk from the previous boss, including dangerous or slow mobs that may require different approaches.

## Start -> Solvaring

### Melrode Monastary and Melrode Town

Click through the intro dialogue, max your text speed, and then pick up everything but the basement items.

**Objectives**:
1. Mash through opening dialogue.
2. Open the menu and max your text speed.
3. Get the **Honey Bread** (chest) and **Fresh Bread** (giver).
4. Leave the Monastary.
5. Pick up the hay spirit.
6. Pick up the White Wings.
7. Go into the farmer's house and get the Fresh Bread.
8. Pick up the field spirit.
9. Use White Wings.
10. Leave Melrode.

### Walk to Dondoran

Try to avoid enemy encounters on the way to Dondoran.  Fighting Hell Hounds if usually fine if they spawn in front of you.

**Objectives**:
1. Pick up all spirits along the way
2. Kill Hell Hounds that spawn in front of you

### Dondoran

We're just here to pick up a spirit and a Dew Drop if necessary.

**Objectives**:
1. Pick up a Dew Drop from the tavern if you didn't get one from Hell Hounds.
2. Pick up the Yellow Wings.
3. Get the spirit at the bottom of the sand pit.
4. Use the Yellow Wings and leave.
5. Walk to Connor Forest

### Connor Forest

The goal here will depend on how you plan to kill Solvaring.  This guide will assume the traditional High Defense route, but you are welcome to experiment with other routes etc.

**Objectives**:
1. Pick up all spirits
2. Pick up Giant's Shoes from the small hut near the entrance
3. Reach 16 Water minimum
4. Grind to 61 HP minimum (see below)
5. Enter Solvaring's room

For the HP grind, fight Frog Knights and Marionastys while intentionally being hit by their Wind Cutter attacks.  It helps to split this grind up into multiple encounters, as these attacks only deal 1-2 damage once brian has been struck enough to have 55 HP.

### Boss: Solvaring

Solvaring is a primary reason why people dislike this category, as he's considered heavily RNG dependent.  This can be true, but this strategy will usually kill him.

**Before starting the fight:** You can open the Honey Bread chest by hugging the leftmost wall before starting the encounter -- this will make the fight much easier.  Similarly, you can loot the Mint Leaves by hugging the right wall, but this route will not use them on the boss.

|⚔|Boss Health|Earth Goal|Water Goal|Health Goal|Mana Goal|Est. Time|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Solvaring**|200|1|16-17+|61+|15|**20 minutes**|

**Objectives**:
1. Start the encounter near the Honey Bread ramp
2. Face to the right and use the Giant's Shoes
3. Hold Right when he casts the beam, you should be able to dodge it
4. Run up to him and cast **Water Pillar 3**
5. Cast **Water Pillar 1** as your main damage ability
6. Eat a bread when your health is at or below 19

Once the fight is over, loot the Mint Leaves and **cast Exit** to return to the forest entrance.  From there, run towards the forest gate, which will now be open.

## Zelse

|⚔|Boss Health|Earth Goal|Water Goal|Health Goal|Mana Goal|Est. Time|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Zelse**|680|24+|19 or 23|82+|19+|**40 minutes**|

**Boss Notes:** Cast avalanche from a distance to bait the mid-ranged attack, then run away when he casts it.

## Nepty

|⚔|Boss Health|Earth Goal|Water Goal|Health Goal|Mana Goal|Est. Time|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**Nepty**|880|36+|25|98+|21+|**25 minutes**|

**Boss Notes:** She is small and avalanche will miss, be patient and treat her like Zelse to bait the 3-Bubble attack.

## Shilf
