## Quest 64 Glitchless Any % Guide

Hey there! üëã

If you are reading this, then you likely have an interest in either learning how to run Quest 64 or on improving an existing time.  In either case, this guide will attempt to be of use to you by including basic information for new runners and additional sections / comments for some of the more nuanced timeplay.

This guide will include a few notes on how to optimize the run overall, but those will be included towards the end of that section.

## Route Introduction

In short, this category has a few goals in mind.

1. Surviving Solvaring
2. Learning Avalanche for Zelse
3. Killing Bosses with Magic Barrier + Avalanche
4. Grind Defense along the way

For the last bit, we can accomplish this by intentionally getting hit by enemies that cast multi-hit moves like Wind Cutter or Homing Arrow.  

### Boss Cheat Sheet

We try to have specific stat / spirit values to both help with the bosses themselves and provide a mile marker for how big Brian is becoming throughout the run. The main ones are included here in a table here for quick reference.

### Section Breakdown

To simplify reading, we will break the guide into a boss-related sections.  

Each section will begin with a table outlining a beginner-friendly set of stats for Brian to have when fighting that boss, as well as a few notes on how that fight can go sideways.  The section will then cover the walk from the previous boss, including dangerous or slow mobs that may require different approaches.

## Solvaring

|‚öî|Boss Health|Earth Goal|Water Goal|Health Goal|Mana Goal|Est. Time|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|

### Melrode Monastary

Items:
- 1x Honey Break (chest)
- 1x Fresh Bread (talk to the kid near Honey Bread chest)

Spirits:
1. Hay Pile next to horse

When the game starts, click through the opening dialogue and open your menu.  From there, **max out your Text Speed setting** -- this will reduce the number of times we need to press A+Z when talking to people or reading prompts.  Run through the monastary, pick up the breads, and leave through the main door.

Pick up the hay spirit, turn around, and run downhill into Melrode.

### Melrode

Items:
- 1x White Wings (Wing vendor, gold sign on house)
- 1x Fresh Bread (chest in farmer's house)
