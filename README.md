## Quest 64 Glitchless Any % Guide

Hey there! 👋

If you are reading this, then you likely have an interest in either learning how to run Quest 64 or on improving an existing time.  In either case, this guide will attempt to be of use to you by including basic information for new runners and additional sections / comments for some of the more nuanced timeplay.

This guide will include a few notes on how to optimize the run overall, but those will be included towards the end of that section.

**🛑 Before Continuing:** While this guide will eventually become more thorough and beginner-friendly, atm the reader is assumed to be familiar with the base game and location of spirits / items.  If this isn't the case, then watching a VOD of Glitchless All Spirits on 2x speed may be more useful atm.

## Route Introduction

Within the Quest community, Glitchless categories have a reputation for being somewhat brutal.  Between reseting on bosses, moving backwards from random encounters, and associating disappointment with the `Miss!` sound, this has every Quest category can seem punishing.

In short, this category has a few goals in mind.

1. Survive Solvaring
2. Learn Avalanche for Zelse
3. Kill Bosses with Magic Barrier + Avalanche
4. Grind Defense along the way

For the last bit, we can accomplish this by intentionally getting hit by enemies that cast multi-hit moves like Wind Cutter or Homing Arrow.  

### Boss Cheat Sheet

We try to have specific stat / spirit values to both help with the bosses themselves and provide a mile marker for how big Brian is becoming throughout the run. The main ones are included here in a table here for quick reference.

### Section Breakdown

To simplify reading, we will break the guide into a boss-related sections.  

Each section will begin with a table outlining a beginner-friendly set of stats for Brian to have when fighting that boss, as well as a few notes on how that fight can go sideways.  The section will then cover the walk from the previous boss, including dangerous or slow mobs that may require different approaches.
