## Game Introduction

Quest 64 is non-traditional RPG with unique turn-based combat that revolves around its magic system.  

#### ⚔ Combat
The player (Brian) will battle enemies to gain experience / level-up and collect spirits on the world map, learning new spells as different thresholds are reached.

The game has 8 bosses, arranged linearly, and ends when Brian defeats the final boss -- Mammon.

#### 🍞 Items and Vendors
One of Quest's quirkier features is that there are no vendors or currency of any kind.  In fact, the closest thing we have to vendors are lovingly referred to by the community as "givers" -- townspeople who will give Brian a specific item, but only if he doesn't currently have that item.

The same is true for items dropped by enemies: if Brian has an item, then enemies cannot drop it.
